Project: Another One Cheats The Dust

We developed a Web-App based on a Queen song, "Another One Bites The Dust". We decided to give a twist to the song vibe, 
and make an App to promote a healthy life, since the beat of the song is based on CPR, and used to train medical students.

The client have the option to register on our app. It will be asked some personal information in order to generate a score
through our complex algorithm.

The client will be asked to fill in a form containing some habits or stress inducing activities that are prone to decrease their lifespan.
